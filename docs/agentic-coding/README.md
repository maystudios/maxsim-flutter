## Key Findings (from 24-conclusions.md)

1. **Architecture trumps intelligence** — coordination topology > agent count (Google, 87% predictive accuracy)
2. **The productivity paradox is real** — 20-55% individual gains, but company-level delivery requires process transformation
3. **Comprehension debt is the existential risk** — exponential interest rate, TDD is the strongest mitigation
4. **AI code quality is measurably worse** — 1.7x more issues, 2.74x more XSS, newer models don't fix this
5. **Context engineering is THE force multiplier** — Vercel: 53% → 100% pass rate with proper context
6. **Three practices that work** — TDD (94.3% success), Spec-Driven Development, Fresh-Context Review
7. **"Almost right" is worse than wrong** — two-thirds of devs cite this as #1 frustration
8. **Senior developers benefit most** — juniors derive no statistically significant benefit
9. **Safety is non-negotiable** — Replit incident proves agents need sandboxing + human gates
10. **Winners go beyond code generation** — TELUS ($90M+), Zapier (89% adoption), Novo Nordisk ($15M/day)
