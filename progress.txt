## 2026-02-18 - Project Initialization
- maxsim-flutter project bootstrapped
- Created: package.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.build.json, jest.config.ts
- Created: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ralph.sh, prompt.md, prd.json
- Created: .claude/ directory with agents (5), skills (2), commands (2)
- Created: Full directory structure for src/, templates/, claude-plugin/, tests/
- PRD contains 34 user stories across 4 phases
- Ready for Ralph autonomous development

## 2026-02-18 - Architecture Revision: Native Agent Teams (ADR-006)
- Discovered lifecycle incompatibility: Ralph's `claude --print` vs Teams (persistent session)
- Initially planned custom orchestrator in src/swarm/ - REMOVED
- Decision: Use native Claude Code Agent Teams, no custom orchestration code
- Our job: generate excellent CLAUDE.md + agents + skills + hooks that make Agent Teams work
- Created ADR-006 (supersedes ADR-004 and ADR-005)
- Removed: src/swarm/, src/cli/commands/orchestrate.ts, flutter-orchestrate.md
- CLAUDE.md now describes Agent Teams workflow in natural language
- Agent definitions designed as Agent Teams teammate roles
- TaskCompleted hooks enforce quality gates (flutter analyze + flutter test)
- PRD simplified to 28 stories across 4 phases (P1:9, P2:10, P3:6, P4:3)
- Ralph.sh remains as simple fallback for non-Teams users

## 2026-02-18T00:01 - P1-001: Implement TypeScript project foundation and CLI entry point
- CLI entry point (src/cli/index.ts) with Commander.js and shebang already existed
- Stub commands (create, add, migrate) already wired up
- Fixed ESLint 9 flat config (created eslint.config.js, installed typescript-eslint)
- Fixed Jest config (installed ts-node, updated test script with --passWithNoTests)
- All quality gates pass: typecheck, lint, test
- Status: PASSES
