## 2026-02-18 - Project Initialization
- maxsim-flutter project bootstrapped

## 2026-02-18 - Architecture Revision: Native Agent Teams (ADR-006)
- Discovered lifecycle incompatibility: Ralph's `claude --print` vs Teams (persistent session)
- Initially planned custom orchestrator in src/swarm/ - REMOVED
- Decision: Use native Claude Code Agent Teams, no custom orchestration code
- Our job: generate excellent CLAUDE.md + agents + skills + hooks that make Agent Teams work
- Created ADR-006 (supersedes ADR-004 and ADR-005)
- Removed: src/swarm/, src/cli/commands/orchestrate.ts, flutter-orchestrate.md
- CLAUDE.md now describes Agent Teams workflow in natural language
- Agent definitions designed as Agent Teams teammate roles
- TaskCompleted hooks enforce quality gates (flutter analyze + flutter test)
- PRD simplified to 28 stories across 4 phases (P1:9, P2:10, P3:6, P4:3)
- Ralph.sh remains as simple fallback for non-Teams users
